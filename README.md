## What is RFM?
Recency – How recently a customer made a purchase
Frequency – How often a customer makes a purchase
Monetary – How much money a customer spends

# Project Workflow
Load and clean data
Calculate Revenue per order
Select relevant columns for RFM
Group by Customer ID and compute:
Recency (days since last order)
Frequency (number of orders)
Monetary (total revenue)
Create an RFM table for customer segmentation
